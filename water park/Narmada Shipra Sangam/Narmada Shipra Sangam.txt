Narmada Shipra Sangam


The Puranas, or ancient Hindu texts, also suggest that the Shipra originated from the heart of Varaha, Lord Vishnu's incarnation as a boar. Also on the banks of the Shipra is Sage Sandipani's ashram or hermitage where Lord Krishna, Lord Vishnu's eighth incarnation, had studied.Due to this, the Narmada River is known as Shiva's daughter. In another legend, two teardrops fell from the eyes of Brahma, the creator of the universe, which yielded two rivers â€“ the Narmada and the Son. Narmada is also considered sacred because of the pebbles known as banalinga that are found on the river bed.
